// TODO: a text element that supports the design standards of the app, including:
// - xs = caption, sm = body, md = subtitle, lg = title, xl = heading
// - color variants (primary, secondary, success, warning, destructive, info, custom) that overwrites markdown parsing colors
// - font weights (light, normal, medium, bold) are handled by markdown parsing
// - support for custom markdown syntax
// - animations for typewriter effect
// -- h1, h2 get xl and lg styles respectively, both get primary coloring
// -- bold text gets bold weight
// -- italics gets italic style
// -- links are underlined and get primary color
// -- inline code blocks get a different background color and use a monospace font
// -- code blocks use the codeblock element with line numbers and outline variant. 
// - custom stylings for the user to add, such as text decoration, alignment, etc. themselves via tailwind
